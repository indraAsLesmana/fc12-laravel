Edamame is not only delicious to snack on but also packed with a nutritional punch. Like most beans, soybeans are sweeter and have more umami before they are fully mature.Add the fresh edamame to salted water (5 grams salt in 450 ml water) once it reaches a boil for ten minutes, and then remove from heat and refreshed in ice-cold water to keep their bright green colour. Sprinkle salt before serving.This has worked well for us but the length of time will depend on personal choice a lot, since some like the inner bean to only be minimally cooked and have some bite while others prefer it melting soft. Also the amount of salt is something you will have to adjust to your taste. So start testing them around six minutes into the boil.The pods can also be steamed, microwaved or shallow fried if you prefer. The beans can then be extracted from the pods after cooking.You can quick blanch edamame and pan fry them seasoning with soy sauce and some hot pepper. You can also toss the shelled edamame into your salads or fried rice.Cook just enough that the pods should easily release the beans from the outer skin when you pull the pod between your front teeth, but avoid overcooking where the outer skin begins to disintegrate.Soybeans are highly nutritious, and they often become a cornerstone of plant-based diets thanks to their high protein levels.­ Indeed, about 15 per cent of the bean is protein. They also contain all nine of the essential amino acids, and are one of the only vegetables to do so.Takes more work but if you cut and trim off both ends of the pods, the salt water will season the soybeans inside the pods when boiling.','[\"https://gabbarfarms.com/cdn/shop/products/EDAMAMEBEANSFRESH_600x.jpg?v=1634630856\"]','Trikaya','vinecrops');

The outermost layers tend to be the toughest, and the leaves get softer as you get closer to the center.Be careful when you reach the purple leaves at the very center — they tend to be prickly, so use a kitchen towel to discard them. When you reach the choke (the fuzzy bit), scrape it off with a spoon or carefully slice it off, and discard. All that’s left now is the heart.The heart is completely edible and amazingly delicious. The other parts of the artichoke -- the actual leaves, the hairy stuff at the bottom, the stem, etc. - are not eaten. The fuzzy choke is too fibrous to eat in regular artichokes, but edible in baby artichokes.Artichokes may be eaten cold or hot, but I think they are much better hot. They are served with a dip, either melted butter or mayonnaise.They can also be barbecued or grilled: cut in half lengthwise, remove the choke, brush with olive oil and grill for 30 minutes, until tender.A good guide on cleaning and trimming artichokes is at https://www.finecooking.com/article/how-to-clean-and-trim-artichokes-for-recipes','[\"https://gabbarfarms.com/cdn/shop/products/Artichoke_600x.jpg?v=1634623528\"]','Trikaya','vinecrops');
